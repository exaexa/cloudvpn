The multi-purpose mesh networking tool by [exa]. This is version 2.

Project goals:

- Create a nice alternative to IP/IPv6 that works with meshes.
- Move network stack to userspace, to increase flexibility.
- Retain simple usage for tunneling and multicasting of stuff.

*** HISTORY

To anyone who is confused why I deleted most of stuff, please use the git and checkout the original revision (probably v1.99.8 branch or so). That project is probably dead (but still working), as I realized that I made many design flaws, therefore rewriting the thing from scratch.

Basically:

1- cloudvpn started as a simple meshed Ethernet VPN which was cool.
2- we had some new features
3- I realized some small design flaws and possibilities that could open,
   started cloudvpn 2.0. That was given 'gates' tunneling concept.
4- More flaws discovered, complete rewrite suggested.

Also, I'm a little disappointed about ipv6. The most annoying concept is the
once-again-limited address length, then the absolutely missing NAT solution, weirdness in special meanings of prefixes and suffixes, BGP problems,...


*** ARCHITECTURE

- plugin based (keepin'em dynamic and loaded)
- similar to forward-only linux netfilter chains
- plugins are here for routing, filtering, transporting data, configuring other
  plugins...
- interfaces kept as simple as possible
- multicore support.
